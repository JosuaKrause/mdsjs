MDS for JavaScript
==================

A multi dimensional scaling library for JavaScript. Only a distance matrix
for elements is required to position them on a 2D plane. This can be useful
for visualizing high-dimensional data, drawing arbitrary graphs, or projecting
points using a custom distance function.

**This is a work in progress and the library is not yet functional!**

The algorithm used for calculating the MDS is published at
